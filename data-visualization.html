        Nowadays, one of the topics that concerns me is the earth pollution.
        People over the years are continiously polluted the environment without
        thinking the consequenses for the planet and the next generations.
        Unfortunatelly, we are species that do not take into account the other
        entities in the world and we act individualistic. In a recent research,
        I found a really interesting visualization of world pollution with
        plastic around the continents, that indicates the countries in 2010 that
        produced the largest amount of plastic waste and what percentage of this
        is inadequately managed. The image represents in an interesting way the
        issue and linken the total amount of plastic wastes with the blue whale
        (as is a huge animal and try to pinpoint the seriousness of the
        situation). Unfortunatelly, we do not realize that everything that we
        discard, return somehow again back to us, even through the food or from
        the air that we breath. To stop this serious problem, we must to act
        immediately, not only as a unit but individually and put more effort to
        protect our home.
